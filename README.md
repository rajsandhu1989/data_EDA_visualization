# data_EDA_visualization
Hi welcome to my repository. I am professor and researcher in the field of data science and machine learning. From last eight years I am working with graduate students to build machine learning based projects.
I am strong advisor of performing data visualizations before deciding to perform cleaning and preparing ML models of any dataset. It is important to understand the data first. It will reduce significant amount of time and effort when creating ML models and improving their accuracies.

This repository contains multiple projects where me and my team worked in exploratory data analysis for better understanding of the data. We have made some changes to datasets also based on the results of EDA and devised some insights to the given dataset.

I sincerely hope that you will be able to get insights in EDA using these projects. Further if you have any query or recommendations, I would love to hear them at rajsandhu1989@gmail. I am also open to collaborations if you have a new dataset which may add value to this repository.

Thanks, and Cheers
Dr. Rajinder Sandhu
